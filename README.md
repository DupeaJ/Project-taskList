# Project-taskList
## Description
For my project 5 we had to make a task list to record things to do in the day from 9-5. The task list has save functions, and restores task even after reloading the page. 
The times work with real world times depending on your current location. and will update from green to red to grey when the time passes that section.
I had a few struggles getting this project to work, I didnt get a working loop going to cycle through times and items so I had to do a lot more code with copy and pasting the same things over and over,
I also struggled on getting the storage to display after reloading due to using an input field instead of text area.
The project was a great learning experience on how the long was works but its much more work than the short version, it also gave me great practice on setting items in storage and retrieving them after.
